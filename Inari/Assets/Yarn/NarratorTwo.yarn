    There was no more food in the forest, so I wandered to a human town.
    A boy proposed an interesting trade.
<<if $day is 3>>
    Good fortune blows towards me for only so long.
    I'll can get my good luck back somehow, if I curse them.
<<endif>>
<<if $day is 4>>
    Some men pledge their loyalty to me 
    But their faith shrivels up as soon as they get what they want
    I have to watch out for such people..
